To do list:
* Read readMe with images and skills.
* Make the spinner div as a component.
* DRY-all the select's options, the logo's letters, all the ctrl c & d when i just change content- make as  arrays or objects and build with loops. Make the code shorter.
* Split the context file to many files with correct names.
* Split the big style file to many files (as i did with the spinner's classes).
